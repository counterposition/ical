## Requirements

- **macOS** (any recent version)
- **Go 1.24+**
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`)
- Calendar access permission (macOS will prompt on first run)

ical uses cgo to compile native EventKit bindings directly into the binary. It does not work on Linux or Windows.

## Installation

This is a fork of [BRO3886/ical](https://github.com/BRO3886/ical), maintained at
[counterposition/ical](https://github.com/counterposition/ical). It publishes **no binary releases,
no Homebrew tap, and no install script** — build it from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/counterposition/ical.git
cd ical
make build
# Binary at ./bin/ical
```

Then put it on your `PATH` — either copy the built binary:

```bash
sudo cp bin/ical /usr/local/bin/ical
```

...or install it to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` instead:

```bash
make install
```

> `go install github.com/counterposition/ical/cmd/ical@latest` does **not** work: `go.mod` still
> declares the module as `github.com/BRO3886/ical`, so Go rejects the module-path mismatch.

### Want the upstream build instead?

Upstream's Homebrew tap, `curl | bash` installer, `go install` path, and release tarballs install
*upstream's* build, not this fork. See
[upstream's install instructions](https://github.com/BRO3886/ical#install).

### Development checks

```bash
make test
make lint
```

`make lint` uses pinned tools from `mise.toml` when `mise` is installed, and falls back to
`golangci-lint` on `PATH`.

## First Run

On the first invocation, macOS will display a permission dialog asking for Calendar access. Grant it — ical needs this to read and write events.

```bash
ical today
```

This shows all events for today in a table format with row numbers, times, titles, and calendar names.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Today's agenda
ical today

# Next 7 days
ical upcoming

# List events in a date range
ical list -f "next monday" -t "next friday"

# Search events by title
ical search "standup" -c Work

# Show event details (interactive picker)
ical show

# Create an event
ical add "Team Standup" -s "tomorrow 9am" -e "tomorrow 9:30am" -c Work

# Create interactively with a guided form
ical add -i

# Delete an event (interactive picker with confirmation)
ical delete
```

## Output Formats

All list and show commands support three output formats via the `--output` (or `-o`) flag:

| Format  | Description                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| `table` | Human-readable table with colors       |
| `json`  | Structured JSON (ISO 8601 dates, full event IDs) |
| `plain` | Simple line-based output for grepping  |

```bash
# JSON output for scripting
ical today -o json | jq '.[].title'

# Plain output for grep
ical today -o plain | grep "standup"
```

## Interactive Mode

ical supports two kinds of interactive workflows, both powered by [charmbracelet/huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) with the Catppuccin theme.

### Guided Forms

The `-i` flag on `add` and `update` launches a step-by-step form where you fill in each field — title, calendar, start/end time, location, alerts, and recurrence — with validation and dropdowns.

```bash
# Create an event interactively
ical add -i

# Update an event interactively (pick event, then edit fields)
ical update -i
```

### Event Picker

Running `show`, `update`, or `delete` with no argument opens a searchable picker that lists your upcoming events. Type to filter, then press Enter to select.

```bash
# Pick an event to view
ical show

# Pick an event to delete (with confirmation)
ical delete

# Pick an event to update
ical update
```

You can also combine the picker with the guided form:

```bash
# Pick an event, then edit it in a form
ical update -i
```

## AI Agent Skills

ical includes an embedded [agent skill](https://agentskills.io) that teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Augment) how to use it. The skill files contain the same documentation published at [ical.sidv.dev/docs](https://ical.sidv.dev/docs). You can preview what would be installed before writing anything:

```bash
# Preview the files that would be written
ical skills install --dry-run

# Install (interactive picker + confirmation prompt)
ical skills install
```

You can also target specific agents directly:

```bash
ical skills install --agent claude    # Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Augment
ical skills install --agent codex     # Codex CLI, Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, Augment
ical skills install --agent openclaw  # OpenClaw
ical skills install --agent all       # All agents
```

After updating ical to a new version, run `ical skills install` again to update the skill files. ical will notify you if installed skills are outdated.

## Color Support

ical respects the `NO_COLOR` environment variable. You can also pass `--no-color` to disable colored output.

## Shell Completions

Generate completions for your shell:

```bash
# Bash
ical completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ical

# Zsh
ical completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ical"

# Fish
ical completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ical.fish
```
