# ical

A fast, native macOS Calendar CLI built on [go-eventkit](https://github.com/BRO3886/go-eventkit).

Full CRUD for calendar events, natural language dates, recurrence support, import/export, and multiple output formats — all via EventKit (3000x faster than AppleScript).

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap BRO3886/tap
brew install ical
```

Update later with `brew upgrade ical`.

**Quick install script:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ical.sidv.dev/install | bash
```

**Via Go:**

```bash
go install github.com/BRO3886/ical/cmd/ical@latest
```

> Requires Go 1.21+ and Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

**Manual download:**

Apple Silicon:
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/BRO3886/ical/releases/latest/download/ical-darwin-arm64.tar.gz | tar xzf -
sudo mv ical /usr/local/bin/
```

Intel:
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/BRO3886/ical/releases/latest/download/ical-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzf -
sudo mv ical /usr/local/bin/
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BRO3886/ical.git
cd ical
make build
# Binary at ./bin/ical
```

**Development checks:**

```bash
make test
make lint
```

`make lint` uses pinned tools from `mise.toml` when `mise` is installed, and falls back to `golangci-lint` on `PATH`.

> **Requires macOS.** Uses cgo + EventKit. On first run, macOS will prompt for Calendar access.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Today's agenda
ical today

# Next 7 days
ical upcoming

# Next 30 days, excluding noisy calendars
ical upcoming -d 30 --exclude-calendar Birthdays --exclude-calendar "US Holidays"

# List events in a date range
ical list -f "next monday" -t "next friday"

# Search events
ical search "standup" -c Work

# Show event details (interactive picker)
ical show

# Show by row number from last listing
ical show 2

# Create an event
ical add "Team Standup" -s "tomorrow 9am" -e "tomorrow 9:30am" -c Work

# Create interactively
ical add -i

# Delete an event (interactive picker)
ical delete
```

## Managing Calendars

```bash
# List all calendars (see sources, types, colors)
ical calendars

# Create a new calendar
ical calendars create "Projects" --source iCloud --color "#FF6961"

# Create interactively (pick source from dropdown)
ical calendars create -i

# Rename a calendar
ical calendars update "Projects" --title "Archived"

# Change calendar color
ical calendars update "Projects" --color "#42D692"

# Update interactively
ical calendars update -i

# Delete a calendar (with confirmation)
ical calendars delete "Projects"

# Delete without confirmation
ical calendars delete "Projects" -f
```

## Event Listing

```bash
# Filter by calendar
ical list -c Work -f today -t "in 7 days"

# Filter by multiple calendars
ical list -c Work -c Personal -f today -t "in 7 days"

# Exclude calendars
ical upcoming --exclude-calendar Birthdays --exclude-calendar "Holidays in India"

# Filter by attendee or organizer (case-insensitive substring match)
ical list -f today -t "in 14 days" --attendee alice

# Hide recurring events — focus on one-off meetings
ical upcoming -d 7 --no-recurring

# Search with date range
ical search "meeting" -f "1 month ago" -t "in 1 month"

# Sort by title
ical list -f today -t "next friday" --sort title

# Limit results
ical upcoming -d 30 -n 10

# JSON output for scripting
ical today -o json | jq '.[].title'

# Plain output for grep
ical today -o plain | grep "standup"
```

## Creating Events

```bash
# Quick event
ical add "Team Standup" -s "tomorrow 9am" -e "tomorrow 9:30am" -c Work

# All-day event
ical add "Company Holiday" -s 2026-03-15 --all-day -c Work

# With location and alerts
# Passing any --alert gives the event exactly those alerts — the calendar's
# default alerts are not merged in. Omit --alert to inherit the default,
# or pass --no-alert for zero alerts.
ical add "Dinner" -s "friday 7pm" -e "friday 9pm" \
  -l "The Restaurant, 123 Main St" --alert 1h --alert 15m

# Suppress the calendar's default alerts (e.g. for mirrored busy blocks)
ical add "Busy block" -s "tomorrow 9am" -e "tomorrow 10am" --no-alert

# Recurring event
ical add "Weekly Sync" -s "next monday 10am" -e "next monday 11am" \
  --repeat weekly --repeat-days mon -c Work

# Recurring with end date
ical add "Daily Standup" -s "tomorrow 9am" -e "tomorrow 9:15am" \
  --repeat daily --repeat-until "2026-12-31" -c Work

# With timezone
ical add "NYC Meeting" -s "tomorrow 2pm" -e "tomorrow 3pm" \
  --timezone "America/New_York" -c Work
```

## Updating Events

```bash
# Interactive picker + guided form
ical update -i

# Update by row number from last listing
ical update 2 --title "New Title"

# Reschedule
ical update 3 -s "tomorrow 2pm" -e "tomorrow 3pm"

# Update future occurrences of recurring event
ical update 1 --span future --title "New Series Name"
```

## Deleting Events

```bash
# Interactive picker with confirmation
ical delete

# Delete by row number
ical delete 3

# Skip confirmation
ical delete 3 -f

# Batch delete multiple events
ical delete 1 2 3 --force

# Delete this and future occurrences
ical delete 2 --span future

# Delete the entire recurring series
ical delete 2 --span all
```

## Invitations & Availability

Invite people to events, respond to invitations, look up free/busy, and join meetings — all from the terminal.

```bash
# Invite attendees when creating an event (sends invitations on save)
ical add "Design review" --start "tomorrow 3pm" --calendar Work \
  --invite alice@example.com --invite "Bob <bob@example.com>"

# Add travel time before an event
ical add "Client visit" --start "friday 2pm" --travel 45m

# Respond to an invitation
ical rsvp accepted 3          # accept the event at row 3
ical rsvp declined <id>       # decline by event ID
ical rsvp tentative           # no event arg → interactive picker

# Look up when people are free or busy
ical free alice@example.com bob@example.com --from "monday 9am" --to "monday 6pm"

# List invitations awaiting your response
ical inbox

# Open the conference link of the current or next meeting
ical join                     # opens it in the browser
ical join --print             # just the URL (pipe-friendly)
```

> **Note:** Inviting attendees makes the calendar account send a real invitation email on save — there is no dry-run. The organizer (you) is added automatically. Free/busy lookup (`ical free`) requires an Exchange or Google Workspace account; **iCloud does not support availability lookups**.

## Export & Import

```bash
# Export to JSON
ical export -f 2026-01-01 -t 2026-12-31 --format json > events.json

# Export to CSV
ical export -c Work --format csv --output-file work-events.csv

# Export to ICS (RFC 5545)
ical export --format ics --output-file calendar.ics

# Import from JSON
ical import events.json

# Import to specific calendar
ical import events.csv -c Personal

# Dry run (preview without creating)
ical import events.json --dry-run
```

## Event Selection

Events can be selected in three ways:

1. **Interactive picker** (no argument): `ical show`, `ical delete`, `ical update` — presents a searchable list
2. **Row number** from the last listing: `ical show 2` picks event #2 from the last `ical ls`/`ical today` output
3. **Full or partial event ID**: `ical show 577B8983-DF44-4665-...` — for scripting and automation

```bash
# List events (shows row numbers)
ical ls
#  #  TIME             TITLE          CALENDAR
#  1  10:00 - 11:00    Standup        Work
#  2  14:00 - 15:00    1:1 with Bob   Work

# Then reference by number
ical show 2
ical update 2 -i
ical delete 1
```

- **JSON output** (`-o json`): Always includes the full event ID for scripting

## Interactive Mode

The `-i` flag on `add` and `update` launches a guided form for step-by-step event creation or editing:

```bash
# Create event interactively (guided form)
ical add -i

# Update event interactively (pick event, then edit fields)
ical update -i

# Pick an event interactively (no argument triggers a searchable picker)
ical show
ical delete
```

Interactive mode uses [charmbracelet/huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) forms with the Catppuccin theme. The event picker provides a searchable list of upcoming events for quick selection.

## AI Agent Skills

ical ships with an embedded [agent skill](https://agentskills.io) that teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Augment) how to use it effectively. The skill files contain the same documentation published at [ical.sidv.dev/docs](https://ical.sidv.dev/docs).

```bash
# Preview what would be installed (no files written)
ical skills install --dry-run

# Install the skill (interactive — pick which agents, then confirm)
ical skills install

# Install for a specific agent
ical skills install --agent claude    # → ~/.claude/skills/ical-cli/
ical skills install --agent codex     # → ~/.codex/skills/ical-cli/
ical skills install --agent openclaw  # → ~/.openclaw/skills/ical-cli/
ical skills install --agent others    # → ~/.agents/skills/ical-cli/
ical skills install --agent all       # All agents

# Check installation status
ical skills status

# Remove the skill
ical skills uninstall
```

The skill is automatically kept in sync with the binary version. After updating ical, run `ical skills install` to update the skill files. ical will show a notice if installed skills are outdated.

## Shell Completions

```bash
# Bash
ical completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ical

# Zsh
ical completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ical"

# Fish
ical completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ical.fish
```

## Architecture

Built on [go-eventkit](https://github.com/BRO3886/go-eventkit) — native EventKit bindings via cgo. No AppleScript, no subprocesses. Single binary.
