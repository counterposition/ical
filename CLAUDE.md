# ical — CLI for macOS Calendar

## Non-Negotiables
- **Conventional Commits**: ALL commits MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format: `type(scope): description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`. No exceptions.

## What is this?
Go CLI wrapping macOS Calendar via `go-eventkit`. Native EventKit bindings for 3000x faster reads than AppleScript. Single binary. Provides CRUD for events/calendars, natural language dates, recurrence rules, import/export, and multiple output formats.

**Repository**: `github.com/counterposition/ical` — a fork of `github.com/BRO3886/ical` (remote `upstream`).

**Install story**: **never point install instructions at upstream** — not upstream's Homebrew tap, not `ical.sidv.dev/install`, not `go install github.com/BRO3886/ical/...`, not `BRO3886/ical` release tarballs. All of those install *upstream's* build, not this fork.

As of 2026-08-19 the fork publishes no releases, so the only working install is building from source (`git clone` + `make build`, or `make install` for `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`), and the docs say exactly that. Publishing fork releases is planned; when the first one lands, `scripts/install.sh` and `internal/update/check.go` already point at `counterposition/ical` and start working on their own — the docs are what need updating.

`go.mod` still declares `module github.com/BRO3886/ical`, kept deliberately so the fork rebases cleanly. That is why `go install github.com/counterposition/ical/cmd/ical@latest` can never work, releases or not.

## Key Dependencies
- `github.com/BRO3886/go-eventkit` — calendar bindings + shared dateparser (the whole point)
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` — CLI framework
- `github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter` v1.x — table output (new API: `NewTable()`, `.Header()`, `.Append()`, `.Render()`)
- `github.com/fatih/color` — terminal colors
- `github.com/charmbracelet/huh` — interactive forms (add -i, update -i, event picker)

## Critical: Architecture Rules
- **All reads/writes go through `go-eventkit/calendar`** — no direct EventKit or AppleScript
- **Date parsing uses `go-eventkit/dateparser`** — shared package, no internal parser
- **Single binary** — go-eventkit compiles EventKit via cgo into the binary
- **macOS only** — exit gracefully with error on other platforms
- Events require date ranges for queries — no unbounded fetches
- `eventIdentifier` is the stable ID (not `calendarItemIdentifier`)
- Attendees/organizer are read-only (Apple limitation)
- Subscribed/birthday calendars are read-only
- `--output json|table|plain` on all list/show commands
- `NO_COLOR` env var respected

## Libraries
- `spf13/cobra` — CLI framework
- `olekukonko/tablewriter` v1.x — **new API**: `NewTable()`, `.Header()`, `.Append()`, `.Render()` (NOT the old `SetHeader`/`SetBorder` API)
- `fatih/color` — terminal colors
- `olekukonko/tablewriter/tw` — alignment constants (`tw.AlignLeft`)
- `charmbracelet/huh` — interactive forms and select menus (ThemeCatppuccin)

## Conventions
- Row numbers (`#1`, `#2`...) in event tables; cached to `~/.ical-last-list` for `show 2`/`update 3`/`delete 1`
- Event tables show a leading `Date` column with vertical merge — the date prints only on day transitions. Label built from already-localized time so grouping follows the viewer's local day
- List-command filters live as pure helpers in `cmd/ical/commands/list.go` (`filterExcludedCalendars`, `filterRecurring`, `attendeeMatches`, `normalizeCalendarName`). Add new filters there and unit-test them in `list_test.go` — keep them slice-in / slice-out so they compose
- `ical add --alert X` implicitly sets `CreateEventInput.SuppressDefaultAlarms` so the saved event has exactly the user's alerts, not the calendar's default merged in. `--no-alert` alone forces zero alerts. Applies in both CLI and interactive (`-i`) paths
- Event IDs: entire UUID prefix before `:` is shared per calendar — short IDs don't disambiguate. Use row numbers or interactive picker instead
- show/update/delete accept 0 args (interactive huh picker), row number, or full/partial event ID
- `--to` dates: `endOfDayIfMidnight()` bumps midnight to 23:59:59 (in list, search, export, pickEvent)
- All list/show commands support `-o json|table|plain`
- Date display: human-readable by default, ISO 8601 in JSON
- Confirmation prompt for delete, `--force` to skip; batch delete with multiple args
- Recurrence rules validated via `RecurrenceRule.Validate()` before EventKit call
- Natural language dates: "today", "tomorrow", "next friday", "in 3 hours", "this week", etc.
- Recurrence display: human-readable ("Every 2 weeks on Mon, Wed")
- Color coding: calendar colors shown, all-day events highlighted
- Interactive mode (`-i`): add and update support guided huh forms
- `ical skills install` writes embedded skill files to `~/.claude/skills/ical-cli/`, `~/.codex/skills/ical-cli/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/ical-cli/`, or `~/.agents/skills/ical-cli/`
- **SKILL.md examples must be permission-allowlist compatible** (#43): Claude Code matches each `;`/`&&`-separated segment against `allowed-tools`, but `{ }` brace groups and `$(...)` substitutions are opaque and always prompt. Chain with plain `;`; every binary used in an example must be pre-approved in frontmatter (`Bash(ical *) Bash(echo *) Bash(jq *) Bash(xargs ical *)`). Bulk recipes pass all IDs to one `ical delete` (xargs without `-I`), never one process per event
- **Scheduling commands rely on private EventKit bridges in go-eventkit (v0.15.0+)**: `join` (conference URL), `rsvp`/`add --invite` (attendee writes + RSVP), `free` (availability), `inbox` (invitations). All gate on `client.<Feature>Supported()` and surface `ErrUnsupportedFeature` if the private selectors are gone. Free/busy needs an Exchange/Google Workspace account — **iCloud sources don't support availability** (`constraintSupportsAvailabilityRequests == NO`), so test `free` against a Workspace address, not the Work (iCloud) calendar. `add --invite` auto-adds the organizer and **sends real invitation email on save** — only smoke-test with own/consented addresses
- **`show -o json` and `list -o json` both route through `internal/ui.eventJSON`** (snake_case keys, formatted durations). When adding an `Event` field, add it to `eventJSON` + `toEventJSON` or it silently vanishes from `show -o json` (regression caught in #48: `isDetached`/`occurrenceDate` were dropped)
- Background update check: goroutine in PersistentPreRun, 2s timeout, 24h cache at `~/.cache/ical/update-check`
- **One predicate gates both post-run notices** (update availability + skills staleness): `shouldShowNotices(currentNoticeConditions(cmd))` in `root.go`, called from PersistentPreRun (to start the check) and PersistentPostRun (to print). Never add a second gate — the original bug in #50 was `printSkillsStalenessNotice` printing with no gate at all while the update check was already gated
- Notices are suppressed for: `ICAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` set (any value), dev builds, `-o json`, and the `version`/`completion`/`skills` command groups. They print only when **stderr** is a TTY — stderr is where notices go, so stdout's file type is irrelevant. `ical list > out.json` still shows them; `ical list 2> log` does not
- Meta-command matching walks the whole `cmd.CommandPath()`, not `cmd.Name()`. Cobra hands the executed leaf to PersistentPostRun, so `cmd.Name()` on `ical skills status` is `"status"` and a leaf-name check silently never fires

## IndexNow

Run `make indexnow` after any deploy whose content changed to fast-notify Bing/Microsoft, Yandex, Naver, Seznam, and Yep. The key lives in two places that must stay in sync: `website/static/9243cdd67ce6db495ec7acddec1dec27.txt` (file name stem == file contents) and the `KEY` variable in `scripts/indexnow.sh`. Live submission will return HTTP 403 until the key file is deployed to `ical.sidv.dev` — merge the PR first, then run the script.

## Build & Release
```bash
go build -o bin/ical ./cmd/ical    # Build (compiles EventKit via cgo)
go test ./...                    # Unit tests
make build                       # Via Makefile
make release                     # Build arm64+amd64 tarballs for GitHub upload
make completions                 # bash/zsh/fish
```

### Release Process (manual, no CI)
1. `git push` — push all commits to main **before** tagging. Never tag unpushed commits.
2. `git tag vX.Y.Z` — tag after push so the tag points to a commit already on remote main
3. `git push origin vX.Y.Z` — push the tag explicitly
4. `make release` — produces `bin/ical-darwin-{arm64,amd64}.tar.gz`
5. `gh release create vX.Y.Z bin/ical-darwin-arm64.tar.gz bin/ical-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`

> **Why**: tagging an unpushed commit and running `gh release create` pushes the tag + that commit to GitHub, but leaves `main` behind. The release binary is built from code not on `main` — a silent inconsistency that's hard to notice and painful to explain.

### Install Script
- `scripts/install.sh` — curl-pipe-bash installer, `REPO` repointed to `counterposition/ical`
- **Non-functional on this fork**: the fork has no releases, so the script exits with a "build from source" error. It is kept (rather than deleted) so it starts working if the fork ever cuts releases, and so it never silently installs upstream's binary over the fork's
- `website/static/install` is a **manual byte-for-byte copy** of `scripts/install.sh` (a duplicate file, not a symlink — Hugo does not follow symlinks in `static/`). Edit `scripts/install.sh`, then `cp scripts/install.sh website/static/install`. It serves at `ical.sidv.dev/install` — that is *upstream's* domain; the fork's `deploy.yml` has no Cloudflare secrets, so the fork's website copy is never published
