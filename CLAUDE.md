# ical — CLI for macOS Calendar

## Non-Negotiables
- **Conventional Commits**: ALL commits MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format: `type(scope): description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`. No exceptions.

## What is this?
Go CLI wrapping macOS Calendar via `go-eventkit`. Native EventKit bindings for 3000x faster reads than AppleScript. Single binary. Provides CRUD for events/calendars, natural language dates, recurrence rules, import/export, and multiple output formats.

**Repository**: `github.com/counterposition/ical` — a fork of `github.com/BRO3886/ical` (remote `upstream`).

**Distribution identity**: install instructions must point to `counterposition/ical`. The fork owns its Go module path, GitHub releases, checksums, installer, and update feed. Never direct users to an upstream distribution path because that installs a different build.

**Module identity**: `go.mod` declares `github.com/counterposition/ical`; every self-import must use that path. `make check-module` guards against upstream self-imports returning during a rebase.

**Version line**: fork releases begin at `v0.100.0` and use normal pre-1.0 semantic versioning. Upstream `v0.x` tags remain unchanged ancestry markers and are never published as fork releases.

## Key Dependencies
- `github.com/BRO3886/go-eventkit` — calendar bindings + shared dateparser (the whole point)
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` — CLI framework
- `github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter` v1.x — table output (new API: `NewTable()`, `.Header()`, `.Append()`, `.Render()`)
- `github.com/fatih/color` — terminal colors
- `github.com/charmbracelet/huh` — interactive forms (add -i, update -i, event picker)

## Critical: Architecture Rules
- **All reads/writes go through `go-eventkit/calendar`** — no direct EventKit or AppleScript
- **Date parsing uses `go-eventkit/dateparser`** — shared package, no internal parser
- **Single binary** — go-eventkit compiles EventKit via cgo into the binary
- **macOS only** — exit gracefully with error on other platforms
- Events require date ranges for queries — no unbounded fetches
- `eventIdentifier` is the stable ID (not `calendarItemIdentifier`)
- Attendees/organizer are read-only (Apple limitation)
- Subscribed/birthday calendars are read-only
- `--output json|table|plain` on all list/show commands
- `NO_COLOR` env var respected

## Libraries
- `spf13/cobra` — CLI framework
- `olekukonko/tablewriter` v1.x — **new API**: `NewTable()`, `.Header()`, `.Append()`, `.Render()` (NOT the old `SetHeader`/`SetBorder` API)
- `fatih/color` — terminal colors
- `olekukonko/tablewriter/tw` — alignment constants (`tw.AlignLeft`)
- `charmbracelet/huh` — interactive forms and select menus (ThemeCatppuccin)

## Conventions
- Row numbers (`#1`, `#2`...) in event tables; cached to `~/.ical-last-list` for `show 2`/`update 3`/`delete 1`
- Event tables show a leading `Date` column with vertical merge — the date prints only on day transitions. Label built from already-localized time so grouping follows the viewer's local day
- List-command filters live as pure helpers in `cmd/ical/commands/list.go` (`filterExcludedCalendars`, `filterRecurring`, `attendeeMatches`, `normalizeCalendarName`). Add new filters there and unit-test them in `list_test.go` — keep them slice-in / slice-out so they compose
- `ical add --alert X` implicitly sets `CreateEventInput.SuppressDefaultAlarms` so the saved event has exactly the user's alerts, not the calendar's default merged in. `--no-alert` alone forces zero alerts. Applies in both CLI and interactive (`-i`) paths
- Event IDs: entire UUID prefix before `:` is shared per calendar — short IDs don't disambiguate. Use row numbers or interactive picker instead
- show/update/delete accept 0 args (interactive huh picker), row number, or full/partial event ID
- `--to` dates: `endOfDayIfMidnight()` bumps midnight to 23:59:59 (in list, search, export, pickEvent)
- All list/show commands support `-o json|table|plain`
- Date display: human-readable by default, ISO 8601 in JSON
- Confirmation prompt for delete, `--force` to skip; batch delete with multiple args
- Recurrence rules validated via `RecurrenceRule.Validate()` before EventKit call
- Natural language dates: "today", "tomorrow", "next friday", "in 3 hours", "this week", etc.
- Recurrence display: human-readable ("Every 2 weeks on Mon, Wed")
- Color coding: calendar colors shown, all-day events highlighted
- Interactive mode (`-i`): add and update support guided huh forms
- `ical skills install` writes embedded skill files to `~/.claude/skills/ical-cli/`, `~/.codex/skills/ical-cli/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/ical-cli/`, or `~/.agents/skills/ical-cli/`
- **SKILL.md examples must be permission-allowlist compatible** (#43): Claude Code matches each `;`/`&&`-separated segment against `allowed-tools`, but `{ }` brace groups and `$(...)` substitutions are opaque and always prompt. Chain with plain `;`; every binary used in an example must be pre-approved in frontmatter (`Bash(ical *) Bash(echo *) Bash(jq *) Bash(xargs ical *)`). Bulk recipes pass all IDs to one `ical delete` (xargs without `-I`), never one process per event
- **Scheduling commands rely on private EventKit bridges in go-eventkit (v0.15.0+)**: `join` (conference URL), `rsvp`/`add --invite` (attendee writes + RSVP), `free` (availability), `inbox` (invitations). All gate on `client.<Feature>Supported()` and surface `ErrUnsupportedFeature` if the private selectors are gone. Free/busy needs an Exchange/Google Workspace account — **iCloud sources don't support availability** (`constraintSupportsAvailabilityRequests == NO`), so test `free` against a Workspace address, not the Work (iCloud) calendar. `add --invite` auto-adds the organizer and **sends real invitation email on save** — only smoke-test with own/consented addresses
- **`show -o json` and `list -o json` both route through `internal/ui.eventJSON`** (snake_case keys, formatted durations). When adding an `Event` field, add it to `eventJSON` + `toEventJSON` or it silently vanishes from `show -o json` (regression caught in #48: `isDetached`/`occurrenceDate` were dropped)
- Background update check: goroutine in PersistentPreRun, 2s timeout, 24h cache at `~/.cache/ical/update-check`
- **One predicate gates both post-run notices** (update availability + skills staleness): `shouldShowNotices(currentNoticeConditions(cmd))` in `root.go`, called from PersistentPreRun (to start the check) and PersistentPostRun (to print). Never add a second gate — the original bug in #50 was `printSkillsStalenessNotice` printing with no gate at all while the update check was already gated
- Notices are suppressed for: `ICAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` set (any value), dev builds, `-o json`, and the `version`/`completion`/`skills` command groups. They print only when **stderr** is a TTY — stderr is where notices go, so stdout's file type is irrelevant. `ical list > out.json` still shows them; `ical list 2> log` does not
- Meta-command matching walks the whole `cmd.CommandPath()`, not `cmd.Name()`. Cobra hands the executed leaf to PersistentPostRun, so `cmd.Name()` on `ical skills status` is `"status"` and a leaf-name check silently never fires

## IndexNow

Run `make indexnow` after any deploy whose content changed to fast-notify Bing/Microsoft, Yandex, Naver, Seznam, and Yep. The key lives in two places that must stay in sync: `website/static/9243cdd67ce6db495ec7acddec1dec27.txt` (file name stem == file contents) and the `KEY` variable in `scripts/indexnow.sh`. Live submission will return HTTP 403 until the key file is deployed to `ical.sidv.dev` — merge the PR first, then run the script.

## Build & Release
```bash
go build -o bin/ical ./cmd/ical    # Build (compiles EventKit via cgo)
go test ./...                    # Unit tests
make build                       # Via Makefile
make release                     # Build arm64+amd64 tarballs for GitHub upload
make completions                 # bash/zsh/fish
```

### Release Process
1. Run `make check-module`, `make test`, `make lint`, and `mise x -- make lint-actions`.
2. Run `make release VERSION=vX.Y.Z` and verify the native archive reports the exact version.
3. Push all commits to `main` **before** tagging. Never tag unpushed commits.
4. Create and push a `v0.100+` tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` repeats validation and publishes both architecture tarballs plus `SHA256SUMS`.
5. Wait for the Release workflow, inspect the release, and verify `go install github.com/counterposition/ical/cmd/ical@vX.Y.Z` from a clean environment.

> **Why**: tagging an unpushed commit and running `gh release create` pushes the tag + that commit to GitHub, but leaves `main` behind. The release binary is built from code not on `main` — a silent inconsistency that's hard to notice and painful to explain.

### Install Script
- `scripts/install.sh` — downloads the latest `counterposition/ical` release asset for the host architecture and verifies it against `SHA256SUMS`
- `website/static/install` is a **manual byte-for-byte copy** of `scripts/install.sh` (a duplicate file, not a symlink — Hugo does not follow symlinks in `static/`). Edit `scripts/install.sh`, then `cp scripts/install.sh website/static/install`. It serves at `ical.sidv.dev/install` — that is *upstream's* domain; the fork's `deploy.yml` has no Cloudflare secrets, so the fork's website copy is never published
