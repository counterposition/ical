# script will not find anything to install. It is kept, pointed at the fork, so
# it starts working if the fork ever cuts releases — and so it never silently
# installs upstream's build in place of the fork's. Build from source instead:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/counterposition/ical.git
#   cd ical && make build
